        We collaborate directly with a cooperative of female farmers known as
        Acro Nevada, ensuring the production of our coffee is of the highest
        quality and is done sustainably. Additionally, we partner with Ecol
        Sierra to safeguard the interests of farmers in Colombia.
      </p>
      <p class="text__paragraph">
        This collaboration ensures fair compensation for their coffee and
        guarantees safe and humane working conditions.
