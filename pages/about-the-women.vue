      <h3>Cooagronevada</h3>
      <p class="text__paragraph">
        Kaap Koffie collaborates with a cooperative known as Cooagronevada.
        Cooagronevada is an organic, fair trade, and women care certified
        corporation. The corporationâ€™s primary focus is to improve the quality
        of life of women, their families, and the communities they belong to. It
        therefore produces coffee exclusively made by women, while maintaining
        environmentally sustainable standards.
      </p>
      <p class="text__paragraph">
        The fair trade certification ensures fair prices are paid to producers.
        The women care certification guarantees gender equity, access to
        resources, training and ensures women participate as equal partners at
        all levels.
      </p>
      <p class="text__paragraph">
        By purchasing this coffee, Kaap Koffie not only chooses high-quality
        coffee, but also supports the recognition of women.
      </p>
      <p class="text__paragraph">
        In addition to Cooagronevada, we partner with Ecol Sierra. Ecol Sierra
        is a company specialized in commercial export of specialty coffee. In
        case of international export, this company safeguards the interests of
        farmers in Colombia.
      </p>
      <p class="text__paragraph">
        Ecol Sierra ensures fair compensation and guarantees safe and humane
        working conditions for their partnering companies, such as
        Cooagronevada.They also prioritizes the conservation of flora and fauna,
        ensuring the use of environmentally friendly techniques.
      </p>
      <p class="text__paragraph">
        Additionally, Ecol Sierra guarantees organic traceability and ensures
        transparency in the commercial processes within international markets.
        They handle the management with the customs agent and international
        shipping companies for the transfer of the organic coffees from Colombia
        to the rest of the world, without subcontracting third parties for the
        processing. The absence of subcontracting third parties improves the
        quality of life of the farmers of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and
        their families.
