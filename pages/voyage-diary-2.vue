However, it is hard to know which one to open which day. The calm winds provided us with some downtime, allowing us to work on personal projects, like stitching. Being on board surely improved our creativity. ',

The captain told us many times to be careful, instructing us to walk on the windward side of the ship and providing us with plenty of other safety information. Because of the weather, several repairs were done on the ship.',
